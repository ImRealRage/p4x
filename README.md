The name p4x is a fusion of purpose and philosophy:

P for Peace: Well, i was fucked up at the day of naming this, so tired and wanted some peace, so pax, in roman standing for peace.

P for Packs Code: p4x efficiently "packs" your code, managing dependencies and environments with precision, ensuring everything is in its right place.

P for Peace again: I liked the way Pakistan was fucked by Indian Army, so eventually now peaceful situtation too. Interesting.
